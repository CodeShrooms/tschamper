## Transition from BitBucket

Since commit #b123b6c on master the default repository has been switched from BitBucket to GitHub due to a limitation in member counts.

**IMPORTANT**

The default branch ist still `master` NOT `main` as opposed to GitHub defaults.
All development branches are to be branched of of `master` as before transition
